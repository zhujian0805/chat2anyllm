## Frontend environment variables (consumed at build time by Vite)
# IMPORTANT: The previous value used a Docker internal hostname (chat2anyllm-backend) that
# is NOT resolvable by the end-user's browser. The compiled JS runs on the user's machine
# and must use a host/port accessible from there (e.g. localhost when ports are published).
# We keep the legacy REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL for backward compatibility, but Vite code now
# prefers VITE_BACKEND_ENDPOINT when present.

VITE_BACKEND_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3001
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
